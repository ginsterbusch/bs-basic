bs-basic
========

My personal extended adaption of the [Bootstrap Basic theme](http://wordpress.org/themes/bootstrap-basic) for WordPress. 

Differences to the original:

- implements the Builder Pattern to enable class-based Parent-Child-Theme structures
- up-to-date Bootstrap and Font Awesome (3.1, 4.0.3)
- optional page templates (header image)
- On-Demand loading of additional ressources, eg. a multi-level dropdown menu using Smartmenus.js (Bootstrap v3 blatantly ignores the need for multi-leveled menus with the wishy-washy comment, that it's done differently nowadays)
- HeadJS (w/o the loader) instead Modernizr and HTML5Shiv; currently, without the async loader, but that might change in future releases

My adaptions are mostly for my own purposes, ie. getting rid of some of the butt-ugly WP theme structures, ease of use (FOR DEVELOPERS!), improved usability, etc.
